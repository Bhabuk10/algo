### Definition:
The **Extra Trees Algorithm** (Extremely Randomized Trees) is an ensemble learning technique similar to Random Forest, but with added randomness in the way splits are selected during tree construction. Like random forests, it is applicable to both **classification** and **regression** tasks. The key difference is that Extra Trees chooses split points randomly for each feature, making the trees more varied and often faster to train than random forests.

### Characteristics:
- **Extreme Randomness in Split Selection**:  
  Unlike traditional decision trees and random forests, Extra Trees selects a split point randomly from a range of possible values, increasing variability among trees in the ensemble.

- **Efficiency**:  
  Since the split points are selected randomly rather than by calculating the best split (as in random forests), Extra Trees tend to be faster to train while maintaining competitive accuracy.

- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:  
  Extra Trees generally reduce variance compared to single decision trees, but they may introduce more bias due to the randomness in split selection. However, the ensemble effect mitigates this, often leading to strong overall performance.

### Types of Extra Trees:
1. **Classification Trees**:  
   Used when the target variable is categorical. The model makes predictions by averaging votes across all trees to assign a class label.
   
2. **Regression Trees**:  
   Used for continuous target variables. The algorithm averages the output of all trees to generate the final prediction for regression tasks.

### Steps Involved:
1. **Bootstrap Sampling (Optional)**:  
   Unlike random forests, Extra Trees can optionally use the full dataset for training each tree without bootstrapping. When bootstrapping is used, the training process is similar to random forests.

2. **Random Feature Subset Selection**:  
   At each node, a random subset of features is selected. However, instead of finding the optimal split, Extra Trees choose a random split point from the range of possible values for the selected feature.

3. **Grow Decision Trees**:  
   Each tree is grown to its full depth without pruning. The extreme randomness makes the individual trees more diverse but potentially less accurate in isolation.

4. **Aggregate Results**:  
   For classification tasks, the final prediction is made by majority voting across all trees. For regression tasks, the final output is the average of the predictions from all trees.

### Problem Statement:
Given a dataset with features and target values, the goal is to build an ensemble of extremely randomized decision trees that can **classify** data points or **predict** continuous values based on random splits and random feature selection.

### Key Concepts:
- **Random Split Selection**:  
  Instead of selecting the best split by maximizing a criterion (e.g., Gini impurity or information gain), Extra Trees choose a random split from possible values, increasing randomness and diversity among trees.
  
- **Aggregation Methods**:  
  - **Majority Voting (for Classification)**:  
    The class predicted by the majority of trees is the final output.
  - **Averaging (for Regression)**:  
    The average of the predictions from all trees gives the final result.

### Split Criteria:
- **Random Split Points**:  
  While traditional decision trees optimize split criteria such as Gini impurity or entropy, Extra Trees randomly select split points, making the algorithm computationally cheaper but still effective.
  
- **Gini Impurity** or **Entropy** for classification and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression tasks can still be used to evaluate the quality of the random splits after they are made.

### Time Complexity:
- **Training Complexity**:  
  For `T` trees trained on `n` samples with `d` features, the time complexity is approximately $O(T \cdot n \cdot \log n)$, as splits are selected randomly without the need to evaluate all possible splits. This makes the algorithm faster than random forests.
  
- **Prediction Complexity**:  
  Like random forests, prediction complexity is $O(T \cdot \log n)$, where `T` is the number of trees and `n` is the number of samples.

### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**:  
  The space complexity is $O(T \cdot n \cdot d)$ due to the need to store `T` trees, each containing `n` samples and `d` features.

### Example:
Consider a dataset where the goal is to predict customer churn based on features like age, income, and activity:

- Dataset:
| Age | Income | Active | Churned |
|-----|--------|--------|---------|
| 25  | High   | Yes    | No      |
| 45  | Medium | No     | Yes     |
| 35  | Low    | Yes    | No      |
| 22  | Low    | No     | Yes     |

Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Bootstrap Sampling**:  
   Optionally, a random sample of the dataset is selected for training each tree.
   
2. **Random Feature Selection and Split**:  
   At each node, Extra Trees randomly select features and then randomly select split points from the feature’s value range.
   
3. **Grow Trees**:  
   Each tree is grown to its maximum depth without pruning.
   
4. **Aggregate Predictions**:  
   For classification tasks, predictions are based on the majority vote from all trees. For regression tasks, the final output is the average prediction across all trees.

### Python Implementation:
Here’s a simple implementation of the Extra Trees Algorithm using **scikit-learn**:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create Extra Trees classifier
clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```
